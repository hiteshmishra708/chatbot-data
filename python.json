    {
        "question": "Describe how multithreading is achieved in Python.",
        "answer": "Even though Python comes with a multi-threading package, if the motive behind multithreading is to speed the code then using the package is not the go-to option.\nThe package has something called the GIL or Global Interpreter Lock, which is a construct. It ensures that one and only one of the threads execute at any given time. A thread acquires the GIL and then do some work before passing it to the next thread.\nThis happens so fast that to a user it seems that threads are executing in parallel. Obviously, this is not the case as they are just taking turns while using the same CPU core. Moreover, GIL passing adds to the overall overhead to the execution.\n\nHence, if you intend to use the threading package for speeding up the execution, using the package is not recommended."
    },
    {
        "question": "Draw a comparison between the range and xrange in Python.",
        "answer": "In terms of functionality, both range and xrange are identical. Both allow for generating a list of integers. The main difference between the two is that while range returns a Python list object, xrange returns an xrange object.\nXrange is not able to generate a static list at runtime the way range does. On the contrary, it creates values along with the requirements via a special technique called yielding. It is used with a type of object known as generators.\nIf you have a very enormous range for which you need to generate a list, then xrange is the function to opt for. This is especially relevant for scenarios dealing with a memory-sensitive system, such as a smartphone.\nThe range is a memory beast. Using it requires much more memory, especially if the requirement is gigantic. Hence, in creating an array of integers to suit the needs, it can result in a Memory Error and ultimately lead to crashing the program."

        "question": "Explain Inheritance and its various types in Python?",
        "answer": "Inheritance enables a class to acquire all the members of another class. These members can be attributes, methods, or both. By providing reusability, inheritance makes it easier to create as well as maintain an application.\nThe class which acquires is known as the child class or the derived class. The one that it acquires from is known as the superclass or base class or the parent class. There are 4 forms of inheritance supported by Python:\nSingle Inheritance – A single derived class acquires from on single superclass.\nMulti-Level Inheritance – At least 2 different derived classes acquire from two distinct base classes.\nHierarchical Inheritance – A number of child classes acquire from one superclass\nMultiple Inheritance – A derived class acquires from several superclasses."

        "question": "Give a detailed explanation about setting up the database in Django.",
        "answer": "The process of setting up a database is initiated by using the command edit mysite/setting.py. This is a normal Python module with a module-level representation of Django settings. Django relies on SQLite by default, which is easy to be used as it doesn’t require any other installation.\n\nSQLite stores data as a single file in the filesystem. Now, you need to tell Django how to use the database. For this, the project’s setting.py file needs to be used. Following code must be added to the file for making the database workable with the Django project:\nDATABASES = {\n 'default': {\n 'ENGINE' : 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',\n 'NAME' : os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'db.sqlite3'),\n }\n}\n\nIf you need to use a database server other than the SQLite, such as MS SQL, MySQL, and PostgreSQL, then you need to use the database’s administration tools to create a brand new database for your Django project.\nYou have to modify the following keys in the DATABASE ‘default’ item to make the new database work with the Django project:\nENGINE – For example, when working with a MySQL database replace ‘django.db.backends.sqlite3’ with ‘django.db.backends.mysql’\nNAME – Whether using SQLite or some other database management system, the database is typically a file on the system. The NAME should contain the full path to the file, including the name of that particular file.\nNOTE: - Settings like Host, Password, and User needs to be added when not choosing SQLite as the database.\nCheck out the advantages and disadvantages of Django.\n \nAdvanced Level Python Interview Questions for Experienced and Professionals"

        "question": "How will you differentiate between deep copy and shallow copy?",
        "answer": "We use a shallow copy when a new instance type gets created. It keeps the values that are copied in the new instance. Just like it copies the values, the shallow copy also copies the reference pointers.\nReference points copied in the shallow copy reference to the original objects. Any changes made in any member of the class affect the original copy of the same. Shallow copy enables faster execution of the program.\nDeep copy is used for storing values that are already copied. Unlike shallow copy, it doesn’t copy the reference pointers to the objects. Deep copy makes the reference to an object in addition to storing the new object that is pointed by some other object.\nChanges made to the original copy will not affect any other copy that makes use of the referenced or stored object. Contrary to the shallow copy, deep copy makes execution of a program slower. This is due to the fact that it makes some copies for each object that is called."

    {
        "question": "How will you distinguish between NumPy and SciPy?",
        "answer": "Typically, NumPy contains nothing but the array data type and the most basic operations, such as basic element-wise functions, indexing, reshaping, and sorting. All the numerical code resides in SciPy.\nAs one of NumPy’s most important goals is compatibility, the library tries to retain all features supported by either of its predecessors. Hence, NumPy contains a few linear algebra functions despite the fact that these more appropriately belong to the SciPy library.\nSciPy contains fully-featured versions of the linear algebra modules available to NumPy in addition to several other numerical algorithms."

    {
        "question": "Python supports negative indexes. What are they and why are they used?",
        "answer": "The sequences in Python are indexed. It consists of positive and negative numbers. Positive numbers use 0 as the first index, 1 as the second index, and so on. Hence, any index for a positive number n is n-1.\nUnlike positive numbers, index numbering for the negative numbers start from -1 and it represents the last index in the sequence. Likewise, -2 represents the penultimate index. These are known as negative indexes. Negative indexes are used for:\nRemoving any new-line spaces from the string, thus allowing the string to except the last character, represented as S[:-1]\nShowing the index to representing the string in the correct order"

        "question": "Explain memory managed in Python?",
        "answer": "Python private heap space takes place of memory management in Python. It contains all Python objects and data structures. The interpreter is responsible to take care of this private heap and the programmer does not have access to it. The Python memory manager is responsible for the allocation of Python heap space for Python objects. The programmer may access some tools for the code with the help of the core API. Python also provides an inbuilt garbage collector, which recycles all the unused memory and frees the memory and makes it available to heap space."
